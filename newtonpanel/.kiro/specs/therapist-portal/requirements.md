# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Therapist Portal is a comprehensive web-based platform designed to enable therapists to manage patients, track therapy sessions, analyze performance metrics, and customize treatment parameters. The portal will provide secure access to patient data, session history, performance analytics, and visualization tools to support evidence-based therapy decisions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a therapist, I want to securely log into the portal with role-based access, so that I can access patient data and therapy tools appropriate to my authorization level.

#### Acceptance Criteria

4. WHEN a session expires THEN the system SHALL require re-authentication

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a therapist, I want to manage patient information (add, edit, delete), so that I can maintain accurate patient records and treatment plans.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding a new patient THEN the system SHALL validate required fields and save patient data to Firebase
2. WHEN editing patient information THEN the system SHALL update the record and maintain audit trail
3. WHEN deleting a patient THEN the system SHALL require confirmation and archive the record
4. WHEN viewing patient list THEN the system SHALL display patients assigned to the current therapist

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a therapist, I want to view and manage therapy session history, so that I can track patient progress over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing session history THEN the system SHALL display chronological list of all sessions for selected patient
2. WHEN accessing session details THEN the system SHALL show session parameters, duration, and outcomes
3. WHEN filtering sessions THEN the system SHALL allow filtering by date range, session type, and performance metrics
4. WHEN exporting session data THEN the system SHALL provide downloadable reports

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a therapist, I want to analyze patient performance metrics (accuracy, response time, success rate), so that I can assess therapy effectiveness and adjust treatment plans.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing performance analytics THEN the system SHALL display accuracy percentages, response times, and success rates
2. WHEN analyzing trends THEN the system SHALL show time series data with configurable date ranges
3. WHEN comparing metrics THEN the system SHALL allow comparison between different time periods
4. WHEN metrics are calculated THEN the system SHALL ensure real-time data synchronization with Firebase

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a therapist, I want to visualize patient data through charts and heat maps, so that I can quickly identify patterns and trends in therapy progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating time series charts THEN the system SHALL display interactive graphs with zoom and filter capabilities
2. WHEN creating heat maps THEN the system SHALL use custom plotting algorithms to show performance patterns
3. WHEN loading visualizations THEN the system SHALL complete rendering within 2 seconds
4. WHEN interacting with charts THEN the system SHALL provide hover details and drill-down capabilities

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a therapist, I want to configure custom session parameters for each patient, so that I can personalize therapy exercises based on individual needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring session parameters THEN the system SHALL allow adjustment of difficulty, duration, and exercise types
2. WHEN saving configurations THEN the system SHALL validate parameters and store in patient profile
3. WHEN applying configurations THEN the system SHALL ensure parameters are correctly synchronized with therapy applications
4. WHEN updating parameters THEN the system SHALL maintain version history for tracking changes

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a therapist, I want to add notes and exercise recommendations for patients, so that I can document observations and provide personalized treatment guidance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding therapy notes THEN the system SHALL timestamp entries and associate with therapist ID
2. WHEN creating exercise recommendations THEN the system SHALL allow selection from predefined exercises or custom entries
3. WHEN saving notes THEN the system SHALL ensure data is encrypted and securely stored
4. WHEN viewing note history THEN the system SHALL display chronological list with search capabilities

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to manage user authorization and role-based access control, so that I can ensure appropriate access levels for different user types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN assigning roles THEN the system SHALL enforce role-based permissions (admin, therapist)
2. WHEN modifying permissions THEN the system SHALL update access rights immediately
3. WHEN unauthorized actions are attempted THEN the system SHALL block access and log security events
4. WHEN user accounts are managed THEN the system SHALL maintain audit logs of all changes

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a therapist, I want the portal to have responsive design and intuitive interface, so that I can efficiently use it on different devices and screen sizes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL adapt layout using responsive design principles
2. WHEN using UI components THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent visual design with Radix UI and Tailwind CSS
3. WHEN navigating the interface THEN the system SHALL provide intuitive user experience with minimal learning curve
4. WHEN loading pages THEN the system SHALL achieve API response times under 500ms

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a therapist, I want real-time data synchronization with Firebase, so that I can access the most current patient information and session data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is updated THEN the system SHALL synchronize changes with Firebase in real-time
2. WHEN network connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL queue changes and sync when connection is restored
3. WHEN data conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL implement conflict resolution with timestamp priority
4. WHEN accessing data THEN the system SHALL ensure consistency between portal and Firebase storage

### Requirement 11

**User Story:** As a therapist, I want to export patient data and reports, so that I can share information with other healthcare providers or for documentation purposes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exporting patient data THEN the system SHALL provide multiple format options (PDF, CSV, JSON)
2. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL include all relevant metrics and visualizations
3. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL maintain patient privacy and data protection standards
4. WHEN sharing reports THEN the system SHALL provide secure sharing mechanisms with access controls
